## Hi, I’m Gulshan 👋

I’m a computer applications student with a strong interest in software engineering
and problem-solving. I enjoy building small but complete programs with a focus on
clean logic, readable code, and handling edge cases correctly.

### 🛠️ Skills
- C++ : (core logic, modular design, expression parsing)
- Python : (CLI programs, input handling)
- Data structures and algorithms (basics)
- Git & GitHub : (version control, clean repositories)

### 📌 Projects
- **MiniCalculator (C++)**  
  A command-line calculator that evaluates mathematical expressions using a
  recursive descent parser with proper operator precedence and error handling.

- **Number Guessing Game (Python, C++)**  
  A simple CLI game implemented in Python (with a C++ version) to practice control flow,
 input validation, and clean code structure.

### 🎯 What I’m Looking For
Eager to contribute to real-world projects while gaining hands-on experience in

📫 Open to internships, apprenticeships, and entry-level software roles.

software engineering, problem-solving, and building well-structured,
maintainable code.
